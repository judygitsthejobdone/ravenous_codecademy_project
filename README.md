# Ravenous Codecademy Project

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Purpose

This is an offline project assignment for the Codecademy Skill Path "Create a Front-End App with React". The goal is to create a restaurant recommendation website.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- React
- Yelp API 
- ChakraUI

## Features

- The website allows users to scroll up and down to navigate through its content.
- Allows users to search for local businesses based on their location and keywords. 
- Users can simulate a search by typing in the search bar
- A list of mock restaurant data is presented to the user.
- Allows user to search by pressing “Enter” (or “Return”) on your keyboard, as opposed to manually clicking.
- Responds dynamically to different screen sizes

## Future work
- Add background image to searchBar for desktop and for mobile screens
- Clicking on a different sorting option automatically re-queries the Yelp API, rather than having to manually click “Let’s Go” again.
- Implement my own type of sort (for example, by entering a distance or radius from a central location).
- Add autocompletion of addresses to the “Location” input.
- Make a "use current location" option for Location input
- Add checkbox to limit by "Open Now" and add to YelpAPI functionality and to the Business elements
- Make addresses clickable and have them open the address in Google Maps in a new tab.
- Make images and Business Name clickable and have them open the business’ website in a new tab.
- Implement google APIs https://developers.google.com/maps and add ability to select between Google data and Yelp data


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
